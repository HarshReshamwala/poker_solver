# Poker Solver Bot (Work in Progress)

This project is an experimental poker-playing agent designed to simulate decision-making using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** and evaluate strategies using real game data parsed from the **Pluribus Poker AI logs**.

> This project is a **work in progress** and not yet fully functional.

---

## Goal

Build a modular, intelligent **Poker Solver** capable of:
- Parsing real poker game logs (e.g., from Pluribus)
- Representing game states and player actions
- Simulating hands using Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Learning optimal or near-optimal decision-making policies

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
